# SpotifyMoodVisualizer
Spotify Mood Visualizer is a KDE Plasma 6 widget that turns your music into motion and color. It connects to the Spotify API to read the energy and mood of your current track and visualizes them with smooth animated waves, gradients, and real-time updates â€” a living pulse for your desktop.
